    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>President Biden’s March 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy lays out a bold, affirmative vision for cyberspace. It outlines a path for achieving two significant shifts: the need for more capable actors in cyberspace to bear more of the responsibility for cybersecurity and the need to increase incentives to make investments in long-term resilience.</p>
    <p>Achieving the President’s cybersecurity vision requires coordinated action across the United States Government and American society. The National Cybersecurity Strategy Implementation Plan is a roadmap for this effort. While it does not intend to capture all cybersecurity activities being carried out by agencies, it describes more than 65 high-impact initiatives requiring executive visibility and interagency coordination that the Federal government will carry out to achieve the Strategy’s objectives. Each initiative is assigned to a responsible agency and is associated with a timeline for completion. Some of these initiatives are already underway and will be completed by the end of Fiscal Year 2023. The Office of the National Cyber Director will work with the Office of Management and Budget to ensure funding proposals in the President’s Budget Request are aligned with activities in the Implementation Plan.</p>
    <p>This is the first iteration of the Implementation Plan, which is a living document that will be updated annually. Initiatives will be added as the evolving cyber landscape demands and removed after completion. The Office of the National Cyber Director will coordinate this work and report to the President and to Congress on the status of implementation.</p>
    <p>The United States Government will only succeed in implementing the National Cybersecurity Strategy through close collaboration with the private sector; civil society; state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments; international partners; and Congress. Agencies will work with interested stakeholders to implement the initiatives of this Plan and build new partnerships where possible.</p>
    <p>The Administration will continue to refine Implementation Plan initiatives based on stakeholder feedback and assessments of their effectiveness.</p>
