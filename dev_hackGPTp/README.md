Run the following command to start hackGPTp .

```shell
streamlit run dev_hackGPTp.py
```
Ask questions to your documents without an internet connection, using the power of LLMs. 100% private, no data leaves your execution environment at any point. You can ingest documents and ask questions without an internet connection!

Built with [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all), [LlamaCpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) and [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/).


# Environment Setup
In order to set your environment up to run the code here, first install all requirements:

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, download the LLM model and place it in a directory of your choice:
- LLM: default to [ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin](https://gpt4all.io/models/ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin). If you prefer a different GPT4All-J compatible model, just download it and reference it in your `.env` file.

Copy the `example.env` template into `.env`
```shell
cp example.env .env
```

and edit the variables appropriately in the `.env` file.
```
MODEL_TYPE: supports LlamaCpp or GPT4All
PERSIST_DIRECTORY: is the folder you want your vectorstore in
MODEL_PATH: Path to your GPT4All or LlamaCpp supported LLM
MODEL_N_CTX: Maximum token limit for the LLM model
MODEL_N_BATCH: Number of tokens in the prompt that are fed into the model at a time. Optimal value differs a lot depending on the model (8 works well for GPT4All, and 1024 is better for LlamaCpp)
EMBEDDINGS_MODEL_NAME: SentenceTransformers embeddings model name (see https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html)
TARGET_SOURCE_CHUNKS: The amount of chunks (sources) that will be used to answer a question
```

Note: because of the way `langchain` loads the `SentenceTransformers` embeddings, the first time you run the script it will require internet connection to download the embeddings model itself.
